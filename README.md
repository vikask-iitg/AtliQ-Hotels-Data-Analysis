# AtliQ Hotels Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
The **AtliQ Hotels Data Analysis Project** aims to provide insights into hotel operations by analyzing booking and room-related data. The project involves cleaning, exploring, and visualizing data to identify patterns and trends. Five datasets are used in this analysis:

- `dim_date.csv`: Contains information about dates.
- `dim_hotels.csv`: Includes details about hotels.
- `dim_rooms.csv`: Contains data on room types and categories.
- `fact_aggregated_bookings.csv`: Summarized booking data.
- `fact_bookings.csv`: Detailed booking records.

## Key Steps in the Analysis

### 1. Data Import and Exploration

- **Tasks**:
  - Read CSV files into pandas DataFrames.
  - Explore data using `head()`, `shape`, and `unique()` functions.
  - Identify data inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- **Objective**: Prepare the data for analysis by resolving issues.
- **Tasks**:
  - Handle missing values.
  - Ensure consistent data types for numerical and categorical variables.
  - Remove duplicates and invalid entries.

### 3. Data Analysis
- **Objective**: Derive meaningful insights from the data.
- **Tasks**:
